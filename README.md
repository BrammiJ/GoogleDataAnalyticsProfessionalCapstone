You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director

your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights, 
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives
